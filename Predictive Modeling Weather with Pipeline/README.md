Experience the Weather Insights and Predictive Modeling Pipeline: From data collection and exploratory analysis to feature engineering and model building, uncovering patterns and forecasting accuracy in weather conditions.
## Insights from Data Collection to Predictive Modeling:

* Data Collection:

Weather Data: Collected historical and real-time data on temperature, humidity, wind speed, pressure, visibility, cloud cover, and weather descriptions of various cities from OpenWeatherMap.

Variables: Gathered information from diverse states in Nigeria to capture regional climate patterns and trends, including temperature extremes, humidity levels, and seasonal variations.

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Temperature Patterns: Analyzed temperature data from different states, revealing moderate and consistent temperatures in Lagos throughout the year, with occasional spikes during certain seasons. Noticed variations in temperature extremes across states, with Kaduna experiencing higher average temperatures and occasional heatwaves during the dry season.

Humidity Trends: Investigated humidity levels, identifying relatively high humidity levels in coastal states like Lagos and Rivers, especially during the rainy season. Found low humidity levels in inland states like Kano and Kaduna, contributing to arid climate conditions.

Geospatial Insights: Explored the geographical location of states, noting coastal states like Lagos and Rivers experiencing milder temperatures due to their proximity to the ocean. Inland states like Kano and Kaduna exhibited higher daytime temperatures and lower humidity levels, influenced by their semi-arid climate.

Temporal Analysis: Examined diurnal temperature fluctuations and seasonal trends, observing less pronounced temperature variations in coastal states like Lagos due to the moderating effect of the ocean. Identified distinct dry and wet seasons impacting temperature and humidity levels across states.

* Feature Engineering:

Temporal Features: Extracted temporal features such as Month, DayOfMonth, and HourOfDay to capture seasonal and diurnal variations in weather patterns, enhancing the model's predictive capabilities.

Geospatial Features: Incorporated latitude and longitude coordinates to account for geographical influences, enriching the model's understanding of regional climates and weather dynamics.

* Predictive Modeling:

Model Selection: Chose the Linear Regression model for its simplicity and interpretability, allowing for the prediction of temperature based on selected features.

Model Training: Trained the model on a subset of the data, optimizing its parameters to learn underlying patterns and relationships between features and temperature.

Model Evaluation: Assessed model performance using metrics like Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared to gauge predictive accuracy and reliability across states.

* Interpretation of Results:

Comparative Analysis: Compared temperature and humidity levels across different states to discern regional disparities and climate nuances. Highlighted variations in temperature extremes and humidity levels, influenced by geographical location and climatic factors.

Geographical Influences: Explored the impact of coastal versus inland locations on temperature and humidity, elucidating geographical determinants of climate variability. Found coastal states experiencing milder temperatures and higher humidity levels, while inland states exhibited higher daytime temperatures and lower humidity levels.

Seasonal Trends: Analyzed distinct dry and wet seasons affecting weather patterns, with seasonal variations in temperature and humidity impacting climate conditions and agricultural practices.
Conclusion:

* Predictive Accuracy:

Concluded that the Linear Regression model demonstrates reliable predictive accuracy, providing valuable insights into regional climate patterns and trends. Found the model effective in capturing temporal and geospatial variations in weather dynamics across diverse geographical locations.

Model Suitability: Determined that the chosen model effectively incorporates both temporal and geospatial features, making it suitable for weather prediction tasks and climate analysis in various states.
